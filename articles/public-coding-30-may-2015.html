          <section class="content"><p>Namespace will be doing <em>public coding</em> on the Indian Arrival Day holiday this Saturday. 
What we call public coding is not a structured activity, it’s just a get together for developers to work on their personal projects but in a shared space. 
<span class="more"></span>
It’s an opportunity for you to meet and interact with your peers in the local software community while also getting stuff done.
There are no requirements, just show up, say hi and get to&nbsp;work. </p>
<p>We would appreciate you stopping by even if you don’t have anything to work on as we’d like to engage with as many people in our community as&nbsp;possible.</p>
<p>We’ll be meeting up at the Student Activity Centre at the <span class="caps">UWI</span> Campus in St. Augustine between 1pm and 6pm. Hope to see you there and have a Happy Indian Arrival Day holiday&nbsp;tomorrow.</p>
