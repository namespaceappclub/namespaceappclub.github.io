What do Code and Drinks have in common? Not that much thankfully (imagine the bugs). Since we had an event for [coding](/articles/public-coding-roundup.html) recently, this time we got about the drinking part with our first mixer!

We got cozy at [Bootleggers](https://www.facebook.com/Bootleggerstt) from around 6pm. The rain killed our dream to sit outside but taking a seat upstairs we didn't go deaf with the music.

Nothing more hardcore than getting drunk off a chocolate and raspberry milkshake :) 

No pictures of the food

Happy mixing everyone!
P.S. Know.your.limit. If you're drinking alcohol please arrange transport before you hit the road, arrive alive my friend!
