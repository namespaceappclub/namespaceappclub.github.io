The Namespace will be at it again, this Friday 26 June at 6:00PM we head to [Bootleggers](https://www.facebook.com/Bootleggerstt)!
<span class="more"></span>

We are celebrating Fri Day, developer style! :)

What's a drink up? I beleive the technical term is ['lime'](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/68/Lime-Whole-Split.jpg), at least in T&amp;T.

It's an oppurtunity to once again meet some interesting people (that's why you like Namespace) only this time with drinks and chips.

Hope to see you there!
