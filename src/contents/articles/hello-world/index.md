Hi everyone, we're officially launching namespace - a club for software developers in Trinidad and Tobago. We're a movement to remove the silos of people scattered throughout the nation that prevents us from build a community. 

## Why do we need a community?

Why not? When like-minded people come together great things can happen. There are so many iniatitives happening but their reach may be limited. namespace will be the medium to create synergies amongst our divisions so that as a group we can create truly special experiences. It's also a good crowd to have fun, there's more to life than 1s and 0s :). 

## The namespace way of life

namespace and all the activities we do come from these 5 pillars:

* Recreation
* Education
* Social Good
* Professional Development
* Health

We want to grow as software developers but we also want to grow as a people. As a club we do more than just the tech thing, a community is more than its common interests after all. That's why our mantra is *require mixin* - we're all about bringing everyone together. 

## Join us!

We got a whole lot of things planned out for you, and we really believe we'll all feel better about our profession and passion if we do it together. With namespace, local developers and enthusiasts will finally have that common ground - one module, no globals.
