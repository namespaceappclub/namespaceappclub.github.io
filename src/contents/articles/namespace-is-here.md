Yes! I know you read that already but I'm repeating it. Namespace is here
and ready to shake a tail feather.
<span class="more"></span>

I felt I should make a post to explain Namespace as succinctly as possible, so here goes:

>We are an activity club for software developers and persons interested in the field
>of software development and its related activities.

That was not very brief was it? Let's try again:

>Namespace puts together events and activities we hope people like you will enjoy. 

You being the software developers of Trinidad and Tobago and potentially the wider Caribbean. Think of us as a co-ed network for devs or a Computer Society without the computers (just the code).

Our goal here is to breathe some life into the local software industry. This is one
step toward resuscitation.

Look out for more updates soon!
