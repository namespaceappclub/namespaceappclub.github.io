Namespace will be coding in public this Saturday, the 30th of May, 2015. 

Got some coding to do? Come out and do it in public with other developers.

It's a great opportunity for you to meet and interact with industry peers and get stuff done.

There are no formal requirements, just show up and introduce yourself.

Location: Student Activity Centre, UWI Campus in St. Augustine 
Time: 1pm and 6pm 

Hope to see you there!
